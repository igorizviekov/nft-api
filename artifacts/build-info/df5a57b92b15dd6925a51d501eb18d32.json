WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721 or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol\":\"IERC721Collections\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xba43b97fba0d32eb4254f6a5a297b39a19a247082a02d6e69349e071e2946218\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fc980984badf3984b6303b377711220e067722bbd6a135b24669ff5069ef9f32\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPHXMSXj99XjSVM21YsY6aNtLLjLVXDbyN76J5HQYvvrz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2c309e7df9e05e6ce15bedfe74f3c61b467fc37e0fae9eab496acf5ea0bbd7ff\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7063b5c98711a98018ba4635ac74cee1c1cfa2ea01099498e062699ed9530005\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeJ8rGXkcv7RrqLdAW8PCXPAykxVsddfYY6g5NaTwmRFE\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5bce51e11f7d194b79ea59fe00c9e8de9fa2c5530124960f29a24d4c740a3266\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7e66dfde185df46104c11bc89d08fa0760737aa59a2b8546a656473d810a8ea4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXvyqtXPaPss2PD7eqPoSao5Szm2n6UMoiG8TZZDjmChR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa82b58eca1ee256be466e536706850163d2ec7821945abd6b4778cfb3bee37da\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6e75cf83beb757b8855791088546b8337e9d4684e169400c20d44a515353b708\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYvPafLfoquiDMEj7CKHtvbgHu7TJNPSVPSCjrtjV8HjV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x75b829ff2f26c14355d1cba20e16fe7b29ca58eb5fef665ede48bc0f9c6c74b9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a0a107160525724f9e1bbbab031defc2f298296dd9e331f16a6f7130cec32146\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmemujxSd7gX8A9M8UwmNbz4Ms3U9FG9QfudUgxwvTmPWf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x006dd67219697fe68d7fbfdea512e7c4cb64a43565ed86171d67e844982da6fa\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://2455248c8ddd9cc6a7af76a13973cddf222072427e7b0e2a7d1aff345145e931\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfYjnjRbWqYpuxurqveE6HtzsY1Xx323J428AKQgtBJZm\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x3088eb2868e8d13d89d16670b5f8612c4ab9ff8956272837d8e90106c59c14a0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b81d9ff6559ea5c47fc573e17ece6d9ba5d6839e213e6ebc3b4c5c8fe4199d7f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPCW1bFisUzJkyjroY3yipwfism9RRCigCcK1hbXtVM8n\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd10975de010d89fd1c78dc5e8a9a7e7f496198085c151648f20cba166b32582b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fb0048dee081f6fffa5f74afc3fb328483c2a30504e94a0ddd2a5114d731ec4d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZptt1nmYoA5SgjwnSgWqgUSDgm4q52Yos3xhnMv3MV43\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe4455ac1eb7fc497bb7402579e7b4d64d928b846fce7d2b6fde06d366f21c2b3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cc8841b3cd48ad125e2f46323c8bad3aa0e88e399ec62acb9e57efa7e7c8058c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSqE4mXHA2BXW58deDbXE8MTcsL5JSKNDbm23sVQxRLPS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SignedMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf92515413956f529d95977adc9b0567d583c6203fc31ab1c23824c35187e3ddc\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c50fcc459e49a9858b6d8ad5f911295cb7c9ab57567845a250bf0153f84a95c7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcEW85JRzvDkQggxiBBLVAasXWdkhEysqypj9EaB6H2g6\"]},\"contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd347cedbbbb20374003a2ee628ec86e18f69dc49ae6a1213c7d72685330042d8\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://28e48335a234aebffebb42efcf2743e979ccd2e00e7bfef126a520f1b3ed4c8a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWyWutSHY3RNeiqMMDUsVLKQNeQqytV5EmeivkT8aFzVt\"]}},\"version\":1}"},"NFTMarketplace":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"nftContractAddress","type":"address"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"uint256","name":"tokenId","type":"uint256"}],"name":"NFTBought","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"uint256","name":"tokenId","type":"uint256"}],"name":"NFTDelisted","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"uint256","name":"tokenId","type":"uint256"}],"name":"NFTListed","type":"event"},{"an
